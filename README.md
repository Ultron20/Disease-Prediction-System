# 🏥 Disease Prediction System

A machine learning–based system that predicts possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms and helps users take the first step toward medical consultation.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Many people ignore early symptoms due to lack of medical awareness or access. This system aims to provide early disease prediction using machine learning to assist users in identifying potential health conditions.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
The system takes a set of symptoms as input, processes them using a trained machine learning model, and predicts the most probable disease. This project is designed as a decision-support tool and not a replacement for professional doctors.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Predicts disease based on selected symptoms
- Uses machine learning classification techniques
- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Can be extended with doctor appointment booking

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **ML Algorithm:** Classification model
- **Framework:** Flask (optional)

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User selects symptoms
2. Symptoms are converted into numerical features
3. The trained machine learning model processes the input
4. System predicts the most likely disease

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

git clone https://github.com/Ultron20/Disease-Prediction-System.git

cd Disease-Prediction-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Decision-tree based symptom questioning
- Doctor appointment booking system
- Severity analysis of diseases
- User history and reports
